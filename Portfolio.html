        <h3>My vision on next 4 years:</h3>
        Over the next four years, my vision is to evolve into a skilled and innovative software developer who creates scalable, efficient, and impactful solutions. I aim to strengthen my technical foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript, while mastering backend development, data engineering, and cloud technologies like AWS and Docker. My goal is to design systems that not only perform effectively but also address real-world challenges through thoughtful problem-solving and collaboration. In the first phase of my journey, I plan to refine my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software design principles to build clean and maintainable applications. As I gain experience through internships and hands-on projects, I hope to contribute to impactful software that improves efficiency and accessibility. Working with teams will allow me to enhance my communication and leadership skills, preparing me to take on greater responsibility in development environments. By the later years, I aim to specialize in building robust backend and data-driven systems that integrate automation and analytics for intelligent decision-making. I want to contribute to projects that leverage cloud computing and distributed systems to optimize performance and scalability. Ultimately, my vision is to grow as a lifelong learner, adapting to new technologies, contributing to open-source communities, and developing software that positively impacts people and organizations. I want to be known not only for my technical expertise but also for my integrity, curiosity, and drive to create meaningful change through technology.
